# RPi-Plug-N-Pwn
Pentesting dropbox toolsuite comprised of tools written in different languages- mostly python. Will be updated with new tools.
This repo will become a walkthrough on building your own dropbox and will include a shopping list, assembly instructions, and recommendations for use.

rpinp.py is built around/ inspired by the port scanner script in Red Team Field Manual.
